            <p>A portfolio serves to showcase my past projects and work samples to future employers. I hope to show in my portfolio the results of my studies along with personal projects displaying the value I could have at their company and or team. Reaching your goals requires actions and words and my portfolio will be the proof of my actions.</p>
