                As a new graphic designer, I discovered the challenges of standing out in a field filled with talented peers. Despite my passion and creativity I knew the importance of finding a unique angle to offer clients value beyond just visual aesthetics. I delve deeper into understanding not just what clients want in terms of design, but also how they aim to market themselves effectively. This realization sparked my  shift in your career trajectory towards UI/UX design. By focusing on user experience and interface design, I saw an opportunity to provide holistic solutions that go beyond mere graphic elements and becoming a more versatile in my profession being a "one-stop shop" for client's design solutions.
