<p>This project was alot for me even compared to the club website. Having to implent everything learned before while still learning the basics was alot to manage but it really pushed me to keep going. I was able to study and upgrade both this and the club website but I know in a month I will see a thousand things I can do better again. But i still wanted to try my best and learn as much as I could with the time I had to make a portfolio and make it maluable also one that I can be happy with at my current level.</p>
