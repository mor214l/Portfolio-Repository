<p>A portfolio is a presentation of a persons experiences throughout their career. It offers a selection of one's best work across projects, professional accomplishments, skills, and aspirations. All portfolios should be dynamic and ever evolving alongside academic and professional development with regular updates of new projects, experiences, and accomplishments, serving as a document of educational journey to any employers or institutions. Having a website host your portfolio allows an easily sharable virtual resume making it crucial to anyone pursuing a career in IT.</p>
