    <h6>For <U><B>members already through the sign-up process and have met with the club in person</B></U> we want to ensure you have gotten a feel for our on site loaner bows before visiting the equipment link and purchasing anything. The amazon list is what we recommend buying but you may purchase different brands or designs if you'd like but there are requirements. The bow must be 60", an archery glove, a quiver, and a bow case/bag.</h6>
