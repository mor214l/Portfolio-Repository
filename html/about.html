                    As a Broward College student pursuing an IT degree, I am deeply immersed in the world of technology and creativity. With three years of hands-on experience with Adobe products, I've honed my skills in graphic design, photo editing, and digital illustration. Born and raised in the state of Florida, I have always been surrounded by inspiration from its diverse culture and breathtaking landscapes. At 19 years old, I am eager to explore the endless possibilities that the intersection of art and technology has to offer. In my free time, you'll often find me indulging in art-related activities or enjoying the company of friends. Whether it's painting, sketching, or experimenting with digital art, I find solace and joy in expressing my creativity. It's this passion for art and electronics that led me to pursue a career as a UI/UX designer. Combining my love for art and technology, I am driven to create engaging and intuitive user experiences that leave a lasting impression. With each project, I strive to blend functionality with beauty, ensuring that every design decision serves it's purpose. As I continue my journey in the field of IT, I am excited to push boundaries, explore new ideas, and make a meaningful impact through innovative design solutions.
